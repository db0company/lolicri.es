Server configuration

    The www/ directory is where the http server is "mounted". It contains all
    the images, cries, generated pages, etc. The web server should also be
    configured to redirect any 404 to www/404.html.


How to add a cry?

    * Update your local tree with `git pull` or clone the repository with
      `git clone` if you don't have it already
    * Add the cry or cries in www/snd
    * Add the 300x200 picture in www/img
    * Run `git add` on the just added sound and images files
    * Edit loli_list.py and add/edit the loli entry
    * Run `make && firefox www/index.html` and check if everything is fine
    * Commit the new loli with `git commit -a -m <commit message>`
    * Request a merge (if you forked the project) or send a patch (`git
      format-patch -1`)
    * Wait for a review from a developer

    Eventually, a developer will run `git push` on the main server with your
    patch.

What is the Git setup of lolicri.es?

    We have a shared bare repository in
    GITROOT=/home/$COMMON_GROUP/lolicri.es.git. This is the repository cloned
    by the developers.

    A cloned repository is located in WWWROOT=/home/$ADMIN_DEV/lolicri.es and the
    DocumentRoot of the httpd points on $WWWROOT/www.

    Each time a developer pushes something, the script
    $GITROOT/hooks/post-receive is run. It contains the following code to
    update the $WWWROOT repository:

        #!/bin/sh
        read oldrev newrev refname
        [ "$refname" != "refs/heads/master" ] && exit 0
        cd $WWWROOT
        unset GIT_DIR
        git pull
        make BASEURL=
